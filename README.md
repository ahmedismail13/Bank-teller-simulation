# Bank-teller-simulation
A bank basically contains 2 tellers, the drive-in teller in which people could get served without leaving their cars however, the drive-in teller has a specific capacity of 2 customers only in the queue, one is getting served and one is waiting for the first one to get served. If a customer arrived while the queue of the drive-in teller is full the customer will be automatically be directed to the inside the bank teller as it is free and got a no limit of capacity contrary to the drive-in teller and they are both of the same efficiency.
